Laurens is a Software Developer with experience in building microservices following the DevOps principles, using modern cloud-native technologies like Docker, Kubernetes and Spring Boot. While obtaining his Bachelor in Computer Science he first learned about the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org), and has since gathered experience with the technology both in server-side contexts as well as in client-side applications. In the context of his thesis he is researching ways to adapt the Solid specification to enterprise settings, while retaining the original principles of data governance and interoperability at the heart of the project.

## October 2021 - Present: Software Engineer - Solid & Linked Data
**Digitaal Vlaanderen** (Flemish Government)

As a continuation of my internship I currently advise on the integration of Solid Pods in the service offering of the MAGDA Platform, both on a technical and architectural level.

## Summer 2021: Software Engineer - Solid & Linked Data (Internship)
**Digitaal Vlaanderen** (Flemish Government)

During this summer internship I worked as a developer with Digitaal Vlaanderen's MAGDA Platform, in this context I was responsible for two projects:

* Developing a proof-of-concept Solid integration platform, allowing MAGDA services to transparently integrate and interact with the information stored in the Pods.
* Automating the MAGDA Statuspage through the monitoring information provided by the OpenShift container platform.

## Summer 2020: Software Engineer (Internship)
**Informatie Vlaanderen** (Flemish Government)

During this summer internship I worked as a developer on the modernisation team for Informatie Vlaanderen’s MAGDA platform, a few of the cases I worked on:

* Modernisation and re-writing of common libraries using the Spring Boot framework.
* Automation of status page updates for the MAGDA platform using Spring Cloud Kubernetes and the StatusPage.io API.
* Improving high-level documentation on the modernisation efforts of MAGDA
* Implementation of an OAuth API client for our integration testing project.
* Development of a proof-of-concept service for connecting MAGDA to Solid data pods.

## Summer 2019: Software Engineer (Internship)
**Informatie Vlaanderen** (Flemish Government)

Over the course of the summer I worked on the modernisation effort of Informatie Vlaanderen’s MAGDA platform. On the project I was responsible for porting a number of existing libraries to JDK 11 and Spring Boot and aiding development of a new Business Service for the platform. Alongside a team of experienced architects and developers, I also reworked our Audit Logging technology stack using RabbitMQ and Spring’s AMQP integration to provide optimised asynchronous logging for our new business services with use of Spring Boot starters to facilitate future integration in new projects. I also helped deliver an automated post-deployment integration testing suite with Slack and JFrog Artifactory integration to automatically publish integration test reports for new builds.

Technologies used:
* JDK 11
* Spring & Spring Boot
* RabbitMQ
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Maven
* Cucumber BDD-testing
* BitBucket Pipelines

## Summer 2018: Information Management (Internship)
**Informatie Vlaanderen** (Flemish Government)

Over the course of the summer I participated in redesigning and rewriting the technical documentation of the MAGDA platform. I also developed internal tooling and templating to facilitate the documentation process and developed a new application for managing metadata on the API services of Informatie Vlaanderen.
